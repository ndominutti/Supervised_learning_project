# Supervised learning project

## Overview
This is a deliverable for one of the final projects in my MSc in Data Science at Universidad de San Andres. It's based on the project proposed by Andreas Lindholm and David Widmann from the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University for their course in Statistical Machine Learning.

The main objective is to explore different classifiers, applying different ML techniques on the way. For this, a _music taste dataframe_ is provided.
